For the purpose of this project, the main focus will be regarding finding the best place to start a restaurant. An entrepreneur interested in such investement can make use of this project by, either, picking the location with the least amount of opened restaurants (to prevent fearse competition), or choosing to invest in the city with the most opened restaurants (which could be a sign that such investment is popular among residents)."
